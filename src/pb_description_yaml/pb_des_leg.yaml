## ------ Task definition ------ ##

# Note that is redundandt to set the following 4 task, since the motion of the
# legs can be actuated also through the Contact task. In fact in that way is
# eliminated the problem of disable some of the task for the motion of each
# leg, since we operate directly on the contatct contraint
